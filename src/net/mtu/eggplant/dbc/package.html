      <h2>Generated names.</h2>
      
      <p>This table shows the names that are generated that might collide with
      names in instrumented source code.  Do not use these names.  If there
      are problems with the names choosen here, please emailme and I'll see
      what I can do to keep them from colliding.  I've created these names to
      follow standard naming conventions for java source code so that if the
      code is run through a tool, like jtest, that checks these things the
      instrumented code doesn't generate unneeded errors.  All generated
      variables and methods will be prepended with jps_.  Some are listed in
      the following table.  I've also been writing down skeletons of my
      instrumented code in <a
      href="doc-files/MethodSkeletons.xjava">MethodSkeletons</a>.  This should
      help explain what's going on.</p>

      <p>This table shows the properties that are used by the instrumented
      code and their meanings.  That is these properties are checked when the
      instrumented code is run, NOT when the code is instrumented by
      JonsAssert.</p>

      <p><b>Note</b>: These properties must be set on the commandline.</p>

	  <td>If "FALSE", then the instrumented code will not walk the
	  inheritance heirarchy looking for pre/post/invariant conditions when
	  checking the conditions for a class.  Default value is "TRUE".  This
	  is useful for speeding up the instrumented code while sacrificing a
	  completly accurate run.  One way to use this is to set this to FALSE
	  when doing every day development and leave it at TRUE when running
	  in nightly test runs. <!--<i><b>FIX put performance number here.</b></i>--></td>
