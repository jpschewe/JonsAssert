    <h1>Jon's Assertion Package</h1>

    <p>
      This page is still very much under construction, but I figured that since
      I'm ready for my first release I should get something out.  So here's a
      start.  Check out the <a href="README">README</a> for more ifnormation.
    </p>

    <name="assertions"><h2>What are assertions?</h2>
    <p>
      Assertions are checks that one wants to apply during debugging or
      testing and should be compiled out of the program for final deployment.
      These condition checks are pre and postconditions, which check to make
      sure certain conditions are true at the beginning and end of a method.
      Invariants that must be true at the entrace and exit of all instance
      methods and inline assertions that must hold true when a particular line
      of code is reached.
    </p>
    
    <name="write"><h2>Why write this?</h2>
    <p>
      I wrote this program because I've used a program in thepast called
      AssertMate and it really didn't implement assertions very well and had a
      lot of bugs.  I talked with the people that wrote it and they decided
      to stop development, so I decided that being the programmer that I am,
      I'd write my own.  Little did I know how much I was getting into, I've
      written compilers before, but this is a little more difficult, I actually
      have to modify someone else's code and it still needs to work the way
      they intended.
    </p>

    <name="credits"><h2>Credits</h2>
    <p>
      I'd like to thank my co-workers John Maloney and Rick Chapman for
      entertaining my ideas and giving me the point of view of other
      programmers that will probably use this.  I'd also like to thank God for
      giving me the gift to understand computers and to be able to write this.
    </p>

This is just my first pass at a jar file.  I should have a real version up
soon.  This is still pretty beta, but it's coming along.
Here's a list of the jar files you'll need, I didn't put them all into one
in case you already have some of them.
<ul>
<li><a href="JonsAssert.jar">JonsAssert.jar</a></li>
<li><a href="gnu-regexp-1.0.8.jar">gnu-regexp-1.0.8.jar</a></li>
 <li><a href="java-getopt-1.0.7.jar">java-getopt-1.0.7.jar</a></li>
<li><a href="antlr.jar">antlr.jar</a></li>
</ul>
