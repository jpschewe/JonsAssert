	* CodeGenerator.java: Added code to generate invariant checks.

	* README (BUGS): Added section on reporting bugs.

	* java.g: Still trying to get column numbers to work right.

	* assert.g: now creates AssertTokens for the various conditions so
	that I don't have to duplicate the work the lexer has done later.

	* AssertToken.java: Added so that I don't need to reparse the
	condition and message that are found  in the lexer.

	* MyToken.java: created for keeping track of columns

	* CodeGenerator.java: Created to generate code for various conditions

	* java.g: Now I generate code for @assert

2000-01-11  Jon Schewe  <jpschewe@eggplant.mtu.net>

	* Added some more test cases to the test directory.

2000-01-08  Jon Schewe  <jpschewe@eggplant.mtu.net>

	* java.g: Should parse everything correctly now!  Now we just need
	to generate code and find interfaces :)

	* assert.g: Handels ()'s in the condition!

	* MethodSkeletons.java: refined ideas of how the pre and post
	conditions are checked

2000-01-03  Jon Schewe  <jpschewe@eggplant.mtu.net>

	* TestAssert.java: Added some more code that can break the lexer :(

	* MethodSkeletons.java: Working out how to actually signal the assertions.

	* AssertTools.java: Generalized code to find the super class method.

	* AssertMethod.java: Added stubs for methods and slots that should
	be required for methods to be handeled correctly.

	* java.g: list of mports should be correctly built, still need to
	figure out how to resolve interfaces

2000-01-02  Jon Schewe  <jpschewe@eggplant.mtu.net>

	* README (BUGS): Added bug list.

2000-01-01  Jon Schewe  <jpschewe@eggplant.mtu.net>

	* java.g: removed stuff to build AST

1999-12-30  Jon Schewe  <jpschewe@eggplant.mtu.net>

	* java.g (WS): Reindented with antlr-mode (should be more readable
	now), added comments for where code should be generated to check
	pre/post/invariant conditions.

	* assert.g: Reindented with antlr-mode and commented out extra
	print statements.

	* java.g: initial entry, supports pre and post conditions and
	invariants.  Doesn't generate any code yet though.
