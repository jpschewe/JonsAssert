	* java.g (WS): Reindented with antlr-mode (should be more readable
	now), added comments for where code should be generated to check
	pre/post/invariant conditions.

	* assert.g: Reindented with antlr-mode and commented out extra
	print statements.

	* java.g: initial entry, supports pre and post conditions and
	invariants.  Doesn't generate any code yet though.
