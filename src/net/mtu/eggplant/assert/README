The grammar file used, java.g, is based off of the one from the Antlr home
page.  The original authors comments still exist at the top of that file so
they can recieve due credit.

Note that there my be no <CR>'s inside any assertions, unless they are
property escaped.  So no <CR>'s between the condition and the message.
This may be fixed in a later version.

Note that when calling a method as part of an assertion condition, the
assertions on that method will be checked also, so unless you're careful
you can get into an infinite loop.

Implicit instrumentation is not yet supported, so each file needs to be
instrumented explicitly.  Interfaces need no instrumentation, so they are
just copied to the instrumented directory.  

BUGS:
Implementing an interface that is defined in the same file won't work right
now.  This needs some seious thought.
