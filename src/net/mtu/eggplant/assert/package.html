      <h2>Generated names.</h2>
      
      <p>This table shows the names that are generated that might collide with
      names in instrumented source code.  Do not use these names.  If there
      are problems with the names choosen here, please emailme and I'll see
      what I can do to keep them from colliding.  I've created these names to
      follow standard naming conventions for java source code so that if the
      code is run through a tool, like jtest, that checks these things the
      instrumented code doesn't generate unneeded errors.  All generated
      variables and methods will be prepended with jps_.  Some are listed in
      the following table.</p>
