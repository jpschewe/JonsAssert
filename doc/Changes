Bugs fixed since version 0.1:
- Pre and postconditions for package methods are checked too often.  If a
public/protected method has the same signature as a package method in it's
superclass the pre and post conditions on the package method will be checked,
even though the public/protected method doesn't actually override the package
method.

- hook up to ant for builds

- changed license from LGPL to BSD style license.

- removed dependancy on gnu-regexp

- changed package names since I'm moving sites
