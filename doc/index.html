    <h1>Jon's Assertion Package</h1>

    <p>Jon's Assertion Package is tool that allows the use of Design by
    Contract with Java.  More information can be found in the <a
    href="README">README</a> and in the <a href="api/index.html">api
    documentation</a>.</p>

    <h2><a name="assertions">What is Design by Contract?</a></h2>

    <p>The basic idea of Design by Contract is that someone can write a
      piece of code with a particular usage in mind and can then document the
      usage and then enforce this during development and remove these checks
      when releasing production code.  This is accomplised by using inline
      assertions, just like assert.h in C, pre conditions, post conditions and
      invariants.  Each condition is a boolean statement that "asserts" that
      something is true when a piece of code is being executed.  Pre
      conditions assert that a condition is true at the start of execution of
      a method.  Post conditions are for a condition being true at the end of
      a method.  Invariants are conditions that must be true for before and
      after all public methods in a class are called, in the case of this tool
      all methods that aren't private.  These conditions are also inherited so
      that someone can define conditions for use of a superclass and all
      subclasses follow this as well.  The way that this is done is by
      evaluating all of the conditions for a method on one class then either
      AND or OR this result with the next class in the inheritance tree
      depending on the type of assertion so that the burden is placed on the
      person using the method rather than the person writing the method.  The
      following table shows the rules.</p>

    <table border="1">
      <tr>
	<th>Type of assertion</th>
	<th>Logical operation performed for inherited conditions</th>
      </tr>
      
      <tr>
	<td>invariant</td>
	<td>AND</td>
      </tr>
      
      <tr>
	<td>precondition</td>
	<td>OR</td>
      </tr>
      
      <tr>
	<td>postcondition</td>
	<td>AND</td>
      </tr>
      
    </table>

    <h2><a name="write">Why write this?</a></h2>
    <p>I wrote this program because I've used a program in the past called
      AssertMate and it really didn't implement assertions very well and had a
      lot of bugs.  I talked with the people that wrote it and they decided to
      stop development, so I decided that being the programmer that I am, I'd
      write my own.  Little did I know how much I was getting into, I've
      written compilers before, but this is a little more difficult, I
      actually have to modify someone else's code and it still needs to work
      the way they intended.</p>

    <h2><a name="download">Download</a></h2>

    <p>Ok, I've got a real release again.  At least as real as it's going to
    get.  You need jdk-1.2.x or better to run/compile this.  You'll also need
    the following jar files.  I've listed the primary sitesto give proper
    credit to the authors that wrote these great packages. You can see the
    major changes <a href="Changes">here</a>.  For a full list of changes see
